# Hide Group for necromancers

## Description

This piece of code is an addon for Elder Scrolls Online.

It is based on an existing addon called Hide Group that hide other group members.
The original version currently does not support the necromancer class due to corpse not appearing and unusable to trigger some spells.
This extension aims to provide a solution to those willing to run Hide Group on a necromancer character.
